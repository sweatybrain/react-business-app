# react-business-app

hey this was supposed to be a react project to contain a business card!

also, had minor troubles deploying this whole project to github pages, and at the end the whole content was not supposed to be seen at a full-width size window...
if you could adjust the size of your browser window to be a little smaller that would be perfect!

that was a simple exercise to assimilate how components work on react js.
